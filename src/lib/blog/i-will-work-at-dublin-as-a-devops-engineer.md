_Eventually._
Since 2023 I started taking on DevOps tasks at my job. At that time, my company was pressuring developers to be not just frontend or backend, but fullstack devs. Ipso factum, I was already in a bad mood because I was working with Angular, which I hate. Now backend too? I even like it, but they use Java, and I don't like Java. That's why I looked into devops tasks. It was a way out of Angular and Java, and a way back to Linux ❤️. So beloved Linux, which I had stopped using because of the same company. Nowadays it is even possible, but 4 years ago it was quite hard to get the VPN working on any linux distro. _Of course, I used WSL in windows, which is basically linux, but c'mon -- is not the full experience._

So, I ended up enjoying it. Like, really. So much than I basically moved my role within the team to focus only on DevOps. And it worked pretty well. I learned k8s, jenkins, ansible, azure and other infra tools. Then I had to do something big. Change the infrastructure to microfrontends using Nx. And I did it. It was fun. But after that, some stuff was going through my project and I got the opportunity to move to another one. I work to this another, nowadays. The thing is, it's a design system. When I joined, I was supposed to start as frontend but then transition back to devops. And It was literally what happened. I did some frontend tasks and after three months, I was full time DevOps again. Learned new things like AWS, Nginx, terraform. And after a year, the devops backlog was GONE. Not gone, but basically dead due to **-unprioritised-task**. Back to buttons.

And every time I thought to myself about going devops for real, I never look at it as an "I can do it". Because I never worked with a dedicated devops team, or got real devops experience. I basically just fixed some problems that a developer or a project faces here and there. Is that devops engineering? Right, I did designed the infrastructure of that Angular monorepo microfrontend project, but part of the infrastructure was already made. I just adapted it. And yes I built some applications from scratch, planned migrations, fixed network access problems. Right but, do I have what is necessary to be a DevOps Engineer? Like, I don't even know what they do.

Fucking tag. A few weeks ago I spent two hours trying to fix a vertical alignment of a tag component. I have five years of frontend experience. Is that right? A fucking label alignment? Ok, it wasn't just an alignment, it has its complications, behaviors and conditions. But I got stressed with CSS. It was my trigger to realize that frontend, at least for me, is more horizontal knowledge than vertical. And after five years working, I think its not a good a idea to have a career built primarily from horizontal knowledge. So I decided to go full DevOps. Yes, all because of a tag.

The Dublin thing isn't anything special. I visited there last month and like it. It has some advantages tho:

- Pay well
- Pubs
- Native English
- Close to Portugal, where my parents live.
- A lot of churches and, most important, **daily latin mass**.

The biggest problem with Dublin it's the weather. I'm not a rainy or cloudy man, I love the sun. 100% sun. Sun is my diet. So part of the Dublin idea it's also moving out from my comfort zone. Yes, I could go to Sweden or Russia to make that harder, but the idea it's adapt myself and be happy in spite of it. I'm not trying to become an [Übermensch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch) or anything like David Goggins. Besides that, there are other problems. Dublin is waaay bigger and urban than Porto, my current city. And I don't like big cities. The street rhythm is fast, there's a lot of people (A LOT) and it's hard to find tables in restaurants. But after spending a week there, I realized it's possible to like it. Another problem is the rent price, the cigarettes price, the beers price and the prices in general. But I think a senior devops can handle it.

Another thing that makes me want this is the fact that I'll be alone. Really, truly alone. Alone as I was when I first arrived in Portugal, and when I moved out from my parents' house to study in another city years ago. The fresh feeling of living alone, not have much friends, focusing only on myself and enjoying everything I see because it's everything new and different. I want that again.

So how can I do this? Well I don't know exactly. I know I have like seven months to do it. I should build a devops roadmap, or buy a course, or at least talk to devops engineers. That's actually a good idea, there must be a lot of seniors devops guys in my office. The only thing I did until now was booting linux to my home PC. I USE ARCH BTW. Finally I can say it again. Also, I've already decided to go full vim. Probably LazyVim. I tried Vim in 2021 but couldn't get into it much. I didn't think it was worth the struggle. But now I see that it can be fun, and sometimes we should do not-worthy things just because they're fun.
